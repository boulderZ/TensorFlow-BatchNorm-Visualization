# TensorFlow-BatchNorm-Visualization
Implementing batch normalization in tensorflow and adding visualization through TensorBoard to see how it affects the activations and gradients. Also using tf.contrib.slim functions and arg_scope to define models. 

I am using the data and some code from the Udacity UD730 course for this project. The dataset is the notMNIST data. To run the code, you need to first run the file 1_notmnist.ipynb which will create the pickle file you need to run the BatchNorm-TF-TensorBoard.ipynb. 

This is a work in progress, this first commit is operational and I have viewed the gradients in TensorBoard and have initially satisfied myself that the batch normalization is working as  expected.
